          <b>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg</b> <i>(/ˈzʌkərbɜːrɡ/; born May 14, 1984) is an American business magnate,
             internet entrepreneur, and philanthropist. He is known for co-founding the social media website
              Facebook and its parent company Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook, Inc.), of which he is the 
              executive chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder.[1][2]

              Zuckerberg attended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University">Harvard University</a>, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his 
              roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. Originally launched
               to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one
                billion users in 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares.
                 In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. He has used his funds
                  to organize multiple philanthropic endeavors, including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.

           <b style="color:red">Early years</b><br/><br/>
          Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. In high school, he built a program that allowed all the computers between his house and his father's dental office to communicate with each other.[18][19] During Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot[20] and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.[21] A New Yorker profile said of Zuckerberg: "some kids played computer games. Mark created them."[13]

          College years</b></mark>
          The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002, he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy". He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House.[4][13][22] In his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, explained:
          
          We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.[23]
          
          The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper".[23]
